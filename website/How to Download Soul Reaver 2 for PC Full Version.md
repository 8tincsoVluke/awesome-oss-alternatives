## Step 1: Download the game file
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the game file from a trusted source. There are many websites that offer free downloads of Soul Reaver 2, but some of them may contain viruses or malware that can harm your PC. We recommend using one of these links:

These links will take you to websites that host the game file in a .zip format. The file size is about 666 MB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed. Once the download is complete, save the file to a location of your choice on your PC.
 
## Step 2: Extract the game file
 
The next thing you need to do is to extract the game file from the .zip archive. To do this, you will need a software that can handle .zip files, such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. You can download them for free from their official websites:

- [WinRAR download free and support: Download](https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?&L=0)

After installing one of these software, right-click on the .zip file and select "Extract here" or "Extract to Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2 v1.02" (depending on the software you use). This will create a new folder with the same name as the .zip file, containing all the game files.
 
## Step 3: Install and run the game
 
The final step is to install and run the game on your PC. To do this, open the folder that contains the game files and double-click on the "setup.exe" file. This will launch the installation wizard that will guide you through the process. Accept the terms and conditions, choose a destination folder for the game, and wait for the installation to finish.
 
Once the installation is done, you can launch the game by double-clicking on the "Soul Reaver 2.exe" file in the game folder, or by using the desktop shortcut that was created during the installation. You can also adjust the game settings, such as resolution, graphics quality, sound volume, and controls, by using the "Soul Reaver 2 Setup.exe" file in the game folder.
