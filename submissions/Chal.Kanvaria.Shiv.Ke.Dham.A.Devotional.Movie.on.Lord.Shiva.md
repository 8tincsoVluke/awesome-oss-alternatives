Some of the most popular destinations for the devotees of Lord Shiva are the 12 Jyotirlinga temples, which are scattered across India. These temples are believed to house the radiant symbols of Lord Shiva that emerged from the earth as pillars of light. Each Jyotirlinga temple has its own legend and significance, and attracts millions of pilgrims every year.
 
However, there are many other Shiva temples in India that are equally revered and visited by the devotees. Some of these temples are associated with the five elements of nature, some with the Shakti Peethas or the places where parts of Goddess Sati fell, and some with the legends of Lord Shiva's various forms and manifestations. Here are some of the most famous Shiva temples in India apart from the 12 Jyotirlingas.
 
## Amarnath Temple, Jammu and Kashmir
 
Amarnath Temple is regarded as one of the holiest shrines in India for Hindus. Perched at an approximate elevation of 3,888 meters, the Shivlinga form of Lord Shiva is worshipped here. Located inside a cave, the Shivling looks like an ice waterfall and is one of the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas[^4^]. The cave is also believed to be the place where Lord Shiva revealed the secrets of immortality to Goddess Parvati. The temple is accessible only during a short period of time in summer, when thousands of devotees undertake a challenging trek to reach the cave.
